# ChatBot-With-Python-TensorFlow

This project creates a simple chatbot using TensorFlow. 

The chatbot is trained using a neural network to classify user inputs into predefined intents and provide appropriate responses based on the detected intent. 
The intents.json file is used for training the chatbot model which includes 38 intents for the university chatbot so it contains information about University Inquiry for ordinary purposes.
